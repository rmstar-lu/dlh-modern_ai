"""
A function to create a decision tree classifier using Scikit-learn.

The decision tree uses the Gini impurity measure to evaluate the
quality of splits.
No maximum depth is set, allowing the tree to grow until all leaves are
pure or other stopping criteria are met.

Arguments:
min_samples_leaf: Minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
min_samples_split: Minimum number of samples required to split an internal
node.
random_state: Seed used by the random number generator for reproducibility.

Returns:
model: A Scikit-learn DecisionTreeClassifier instance.
