"""
A function that trains multiple decision tree classifiers over a range of
cost-complexity pruning parameters (ccp_alpha) and evaluates their performance

This function helps analyze how different pruning strengths affect model
complexity and performance.

Arguments:
X_train, y_train: Training data and labels
X_test, y_test: Testing data and labels
ccp_alphas: A NumPy array of pruning alpha values to use for training
different trees.
random_state: Integer seed for reproducibility.
min_samples_leaf: (int) Minimum number of samples required at a leaf node
min_samples_split: (int) Minimum number of samples required to split an
internal node

Returns:
clfs: A list of trained DecisionTreeClassifier instances, each corresponding
to a ccp_alpha value.
train_scores: A list of training accuracy scores for each classifier.
test_scores: A list of testing accuracy scores for each classifier.
